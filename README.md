# App Sync 
An Android App that connects your phone to your laptop through bluetooth. With the help of the Chrome Extension (App Sync Companion), the app allows you to open your notifications onto your computer from your phone. 

## Getting Started
After you download the app, a unique User ID will pop up onto your screen. Input the User ID into the chrome extension. 

## Usage
There is a button for each Facebook and Gmail notifications. If the button is grey, then you do not have any current notifications. If the button is activiated (Facebook button will change to blue and Gmail notification will change to red), then press on the button to open the tab onto the computer.
